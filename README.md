# Social-Feedback-Enhanced-Argument-Claim-Extraction-from-News-Headlines
computer science with ai individual dissertation, The aim of this project is to design a method for extracting the argument claim from news headlines and evaluate the public sentiment towards it. The methods designed are from the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning in combination with natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis methods. The end goal would be the development of a robust machine learning model which can perform the aim of this project with a reasonably good accuracy and low error. The machine learning model would also be able to generalise reasonably well to other news headline datasets with acceptable computational cost.

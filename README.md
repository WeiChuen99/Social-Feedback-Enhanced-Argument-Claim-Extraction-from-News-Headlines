# Social-Feedback-Enhanced-Argument-Claim-Extraction-from-News-Headlines
This project explores using a social aspect (user comments) to improve argument extraction from news headlines using the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling method. LDA topic modelling was executed using the gensim. The news headline data was obtained using the Pushshift API, which extracts submissions and comments data from Reddit. The data was cleaned (stop words removal, lemmatization and tokenization) using the NLTK python library.
